# conversionCalc
This is the source code for my Conversion calculator. 

#### How to set it up
You're going to need node.js. Once you have that installed just open up your favorite terminal, and execute `npm install` within the directory and all the dependencies should install. Once thats done, you can run `npx parcel index.html` and it should bundle and start hosting!

:D
